Hi! This is Leivio Fontenele. 

I am data engineer who develops amazing algorithmos for data mining, pipilenes, machine learning and statistical models that provide values to the product and business.

Interests

I am interested in the state-of-the-art model development in recommendation system, deep learning, and NLP. I like solving challenging problems.

In my spare time I like reading, play with my daughter and wife and spending time outdoors.
